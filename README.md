# WADs made by Gabubu
Hi. My name is Andrei, I'm 17 and play MKWii. :)

In this repository, I will upload forwarders for The Homebrew Channel apps made by me. :)

# !READ THIS CAREFULLY!
If you want to install a forwarder for your Wii, make sure that you have a brick protection first (BootMii as boot2 and Priiloader).

Those forwarder WAD's will be tested on Dolphin (emuNAND) and on an real Wii before uploading them. Just to ensure that the console will not brick.

And if you paid for those WADs, you just got scammed. Those forwarders are free and anybody can use it.

In this YouTube channel you can find previews for every WAD that I will upload here.

# It's working on vWii (Wii on Wii U)?
I don't know. And I can't verify because I don't have an Wii U. Sorry :(

# And those WADs are official?
No. Those WADs are UNOFFICIAL.

# WAD corrupted?
You can just report a issue directly from github.

# What about support?
You can send a message on Twitter or Discord.

And please, don't spam! Just send a message or two and wait for response. ;)
