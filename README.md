# _WADs made by Gabubu_
Hi. My name is Andrei, I'm 18 and play MKWii. :)

In this repository, I will upload forwarders for The Homebrew Channel apps made by me. :)

Maybe I will start making forwarders rarely... Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/tNe6uAM5cQE) to see why.

Hope these are helpful to whatever you need!

## !READ THIS CAREFULLY!
>⚠️ If you want to install a forwarder for your Wii, make sure that you have a **brick protection** first (BootMii as boot2 and Priiloader). (APLIES ONLY FOR WII)

>⚠️ Those forwarder WAD's will be tested on **Dolphin (emuNAND)** and on an **real Wii** before uploading them. But there is a very small chance that the WADs may corrupt the system! So, is your responsibility when you want to install an WAD.

>⚠️ And if you paid for those WADs, you just got scammed. Those forwarders are free and anybody can use it.

>⚠️ FOR UN-TESTED FORWARDERS FOR VWII, IF YOU WILL TEST THOSE WADS, MAKE SURE TO DM ME ON DISCORD (Gabubu#8895) IF IT'S WORKING OR NOT!!! (Aplies only for vWii)

>⚠️ Forwarders for vWii are not tested by me. That's because I don't have a Wii U.

>⚠️ For tested WADs, you can install it without any problems. (Again, aplies only for vWii)

>⚠️ It's also recommended to go [in this page.](https://github.com/GabubuAvailable/WADs-by-Gabubu/wiki/Forwarders-(WADs)) Here you can see if there problems on forwarder for vWii or Wii
