# _WADs made by Gabubu_
Hi. My name is Andrei, I'm 17 and play MKWii. :)

In this repository, I will upload forwarders for The Homebrew Channel apps made by me. :)

Hope these are helpful to whatever you need!

## !READ THIS CAREFULLY!
>⚠️ If you want to install a forwarder for your Wii, make sure that you have a **brick protection** first (BootMii as boot2 and Priiloader).

>⚠️ Those forwarder WAD's will be tested on **Dolphin (emuNAND)** and on an **real Wii** before uploading them. But there is a very small chance that the WADs may corrupt the system! So, is your responsibility when you want to install an WAD.

>⚠️ And if you paid for those WADs, you just got scammed. Those forwarders are free and anybody can use it.

>⚠️ WADS FOR VWII (WII MODE ON WII U) ARE NOT TESTED!!! THATS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A WII U. IF YOU WILL TEST THOSE WADS, MAKE SURE TO DM ME ON DISCORD (Gabubu#8895) IF IT'S WORKING OR NOT!!!

>⚠️ For tested WADs, you can install it without any problems.

>In this YouTube channel you can find previews for every WAD that I will upload here.

#### It's working on vWii (Wii on Wii U)?
>Yeah. But forwarders for vWii are not tested by me. That's because I don't have a Wii U.

>No. Those WADs are **UNOFFICIAL**.
